This folder contains the two versions of the used data_table_reader.
Being website_2 the most udpated one.

This program has been used as a help for data minning, getting a user 
friendly csv file with the initial position-velocity data out of just
the bare ephemeris downloaded from the NASA website.

It also transforms the units to SI (from km as given in the web) 

Sadly it has not been possible to implement an automatization of the mass
lecture. This idea had to be abandoned since the format of the downloaded 
files to specify the mass was not the same: using different labels, exponent 
format, sometimes in diferent units...

So having this file, it is only needed to copy the masses of each body, and
you are ready to hit the simulation!
